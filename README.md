Welcome to my repository for the #WorkoutWednesday Power BI challenges! I'm excited to share my solutions and progress with the Power BI community. This repository contains the solutions and relevant files for each challenge I've tackled.

About #WorkoutWednesday
What is WorkoutWednesday? #WorkoutWednesday is a community-driven initiative that provides weekly Power BI challenges to help participants improve their skills, learn new techniques, and explore creative ways to visualize data.

How Does it Work? Every Tuesday evening, a new challenge is released, complete with a dataset and a set of requirements. Participants like me take on these challenges and aim to create insightful Power BI reports or dashboards.
