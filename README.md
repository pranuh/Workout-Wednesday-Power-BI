About #WorkoutWednesday
What is WorkoutWednesday? It's a community-driven initiative offering weekly Power BI challenges. These challenges aim to enhance participants' skills, introduce new techniques, and foster creative data visualization.

How Does it Work? Every Tuesday evening, a fresh challenge drops, featuring a dataset and specific requirements. Participants like me take on these challenges, striving to craft insightful Power BI reports and dashboards.
